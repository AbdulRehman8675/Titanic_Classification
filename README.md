Iris Species Classification:

Description: The Iris Species Classification project involves building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Goal: The goal of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning algorithms can be trained to accurately classify different species of iris flowers based on their physical characteristics.
